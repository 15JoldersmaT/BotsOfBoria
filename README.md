# BotsOfBoria
Particle simulation (n-body simulation), all 'bots' or particles follow specific rules based on attraction and repulsion based on color, this creates interesting emergent behavior.

Press r to update environment.

Press 0 to make sure the simulation only resets with all colors present, press 9, to unset this (the particles will come from a random number of colors)
